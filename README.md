# Dicke State Preparation
Implementation and Analysis of the Dicke States on a 2-level (Qubit) Quantum Computer using Primitive Gates for the seminar: _Advanced Topics of Quantum Computing_ at TUM.

## Using this code
To use and understand this code I advise to work through the jupyter notebook at `Report.ipynb`. This requires you to setup a python environment. The quickest way to do so (in Powershell) is:
```shell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The notebook can then be opened from the Jupyter server interface. For this start the server using:
```shell
jupyter notebook
```

## Presentation
The presentation for the seminar is located at `AQC Seminar Dicke States.pptx`.
